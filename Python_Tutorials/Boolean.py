# In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.
# You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.

# A Simple Boolean Representation 
print(10 > 9) #Prints True 
print(10 == 9) # Prints False
print(10 < 9) # Prints False
print("\n")

# Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False:

print("Using the IF STATEMENTS HERE to check whether a condition is true or not")

a = 34
b = 13.5
print("A is " + str(a))
print("B is " + str(b))

if a>b :
    print("A is greater than b")
else:
    print("B is greater or equal to a")
print("\n")
